            <p>Okay, C3 Fam, let's kick things off with the <strong>HEARTBEAT</strong> of all great leadership: <strong>Passion</strong>. It's that unshakeable why that fuels everything you do. You know, like when Jesus "entered Capernaum, the people heard that he had come home. They gathered in such large numbers that there was no room left... and he preached the word to them." (Mark 2:1-2) His passion for people and the Word drew crowds!</p>

            <p>But what if that fire feels a little... dim? Or maybe it's just not there for certain things? No worries! Passion isn't just something you're born with; it's something you <strong>cultivate</strong>.</p>

            <h2>What's in the Mix for Passion?</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                <li><strong>Enthusiasm:</strong> It's that spark, that contagious excitement that makes people lean in.</li>
                <li><strong>Drive:</strong> The inner engine that keeps you moving, even when it's tough.</li>
                <li><strong>Commitment:</strong> Sticking with it, through thick and thin. It's loyalty to the vision.</li>
                <li><strong>Inspiration:</strong> Being a source of energy and vision for yourself and others.</li>
                <li><strong>Dedication:</b> Pouring your whole self into the mission.</li>
                <li><strong>Joy:</strong> Finding genuine delight in the work, even the gritty parts.</li>
                <li><strong>Engagement:</strong> Being fully present, all-in, ready to participate.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to Stoke the Flames: Cultivating Passion</h2>
            <p>It all starts with your <strong>"WHY."</strong> Why are you here? Why do you serve? Why does C3 matter to you? When you connect with that deep purpose, everything else shifts. It's not about what you do, but why you do it.</p>

            <h3>Practical Tips to Fan the Flame:</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                <li><strong>Remember Your "Why":</strong> If you don't have your "why," the city is too hard. Connect with the reason God called you here. What burden do you carry for people? For our city?</li>
                <li><strong>Seek Divine Connections:</strong> See every interaction as a "divine moment." When you genuinely connect with people, their stories, their needs – your heart expands, and passion grows.</li>
                <li><strong>Serve the "One":</strong> Don't get overwhelmed by the crowd. Focus on the one person right in front of you. Every "one" matters to God, and serving them can ignite a fresh passion.</li>
                <li><strong>Immerse Yourself:</strong> The more you dive in, learn, and experience, the more that passion can take root.</li>
                <li><strong>Celebrate Small Wins:</strong> Acknowledging progress, even tiny steps, releases dopamine and reinforces positive feelings, fueling more enthusiasm!</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="scenario-box">
                <h2>Scenario: From "Just Showing Up" to "Spark Plug"!</h2>
                <p>Let's meet <strong>Alex</strong>. Alex volunteers on the welcome team, showing up reliably on Sundays. But honestly, it often feels like they's just checking a box. Their smile is a bit forced, their greetings are rote, and they's usually looking at their watch. They're present, but not truly engaged. They're not bad, just... bland. Their initial "why" has faded, replaced by routine.</p>
                <p>Here's Alex's journey as they cultivate Passion:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Spark (Week 1 Focus):</strong> Alex starts this course, and the first session hits different. The idea of a "why" beyond just a roster slot makes them think, or remember. During their self-study, they spend time asking God: Why did I even sign up for this team in the first place? What was that initial hope? They start to intentionally make eye contact with arriving guests, remembering the challenge to "Engage!" They even try to remember one guest's name. It feels a bit weird at first, but for the first time, a genuine smile appears.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Flickering Flame (Week 2):</strong> Alex's team leader, sensing a shift, challenges them to <strong>seek out one "divine connection"</strong> each Sunday – one person to truly listen to their story, even for a minute. Alex hears a story from a new visitor who shares how much it meant that someone genuinely welcomed them. A small flicker of joy ignites within Alex. They start to feel a <strong>drive</strong> to connect more deeply.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Growing Inferno (Week 3):</strong> Alex realizes that the small, seemingly mundane task of greeting isn't just about opening a door; it's about opening a heart to God's house. They feel a growing <strong>commitment</strong> to making every person feel seen and valued. This renewed <strong>dedication</strong> makes them start arriving a few minutes earlier to mentally prepare, and their <strong>enthusiasm</strong> becomes visibly more genuine. They even start looking forward to their shifts.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Raging Fire (Week 4 & Beyond):</strong> Alex is now a "spark plug" on the welcome team! Their genuine <strong>joy</strong> and <strong>engagement</strong> are infectious. They proactively train new volunteers, sharing stories of how a simple greeting can change someone's day. They's always thinking of creative ways to make guests feel even more welcomed (e.g., suggesting a "first-time guest" station with C3 merch). Alex isn't just "on the team" anymore; they're an <strong>inspiration</strong>, leading with a deep, visible <strong>passion</strong> for people and for God's house. The "how can this be?" (Mark 2:12) factor starts to show in their leadership.</li>
