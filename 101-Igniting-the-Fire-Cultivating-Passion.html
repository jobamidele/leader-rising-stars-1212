It's that unshakeable why that fuels everything you do. You know, like when Jesus "entered Capernaum, the people heard that he had come home. They gathered in such large numbers that there was no room left... and he preached the word to them." (Mark 2:1-2) His passion for people and the Word drew crowds!</p>

            <p class="text-lg text-stone-600">But what if that fire feels a little... dim? Or maybe it's just not there for certain things? No worries! Passion isn't just something you're born with; it's something you <strong class="font-bold text-amber-700">cultivate</strong>.</p>

            <ul class="custom-list space-y-2">
                <li><strong class="font-semibold text-stone-800">Remember Your "Why":</strong> If you don't have your "why," the city is too hard. Connect with the reason God called you here. What burden do you carry for people? For our city?</li>
                <li><strong class="font-semibold text-stone-800">Seek Divine Connections:</strong> See every interaction as a "divine moment." When you genuinely connect with people, their stories, their needs â€“ your heart expands, and passion grows.</li>
                <li><strong class="font-semibold text-stone-800">Serve the "One":</strong> Don't get overwhelmed by the crowd. Focus on the one person right in front of you. Every "one" matters to God, and serving them can ignite a fresh passion.</li>
                <li><strong class="font-semibold text-stone-800">Immerse Yourself:</strong> The more you dive in, learn, and experience, the more that passion can take root.</li>
                <li><strong class="font-semibold text-stone-800">Celebrate Small Wins:</strong> Acknowledging progress, even tiny steps, releases dopamine and reinforces positive feelings, fueling more enthusiasm!</li>

But honestly, it often feels like they's just checking a box. Their smile is a bit forced, their greetings are rote, and they's usually looking at their watch. They're present, but not truly engaged. They're not bad, just... bland. Their initial "why" has faded, replaced by routine.</p>

                <p class="text-lg text-stone-600">Here's Alex's journey as they cultivate Passion:</p>
                <ul class="custom-list space-y-2">
                    <li><strong class="font-semibold text-stone-800">The Spark (Week 1 Focus):</strong> Alex starts this course, and the first session hits different. The idea of a "why" beyond just a roster slot makes them think, or remember. During their self-study, they spend time asking God: Why did I even sign up for this team in the first first place? What was that initial hope? They start to intentionally make eye contact with arriving guests, remembering the challenge to "Engage!" They even try to remember one guest's name. It feels a bit weird at first, but for the first time, a genuine smile appears.</li>
                    <li><strong class="font-semibold text-stone-800">The Flickering Flame (Week 2):</strong> Alex's team leader, sensing a shift, challenges them to <strong class="font-bold text-amber-700">seek out one "divine connection"</strong> each Sunday â€“ one person to truly listen to their story, even for a minute. Alex hears a story from a new visitor who shares how much it meant that someone genuinely welcomed them. A small flicker of joy ignites within Alex. They start to feel a <strong class="font-bold text-amber-700">drive</strong> to connect more deeply.</li>
                    <li><strong class="font-semibold text-stone-800">The Growing Inferno (Week 3):</strong> Alex realizes that the small, seemingly mundane task of greeting isn't just about opening a door; it's about opening a heart to God's house. They feel a growing <strong class="font-bold text-amber-700">commitment</strong> to making every person feel seen and valued. This renewed <strong class="font-bold text-amber-700">dedication</strong> makes them start arriving a few minutes earlier to mentally prepare, and their <strong class="font-bold text-amber-700">enthusiasm</strong> becomes visibly more genuine. They even start looking forward to their shifts.</li>
                    <li><strong class="font-semibold text-stone-800">The Raging Fire (Week 4 & Beyond):</strong> Alex is now a "spark plug" on the welcome team! Their genuine <strong class="font-bold text-amber-700">joy</strong> and <strong class="font-bold text-amber-700">engagement</strong> are infectious. They proactively train new volunteers, sharing stories of how a simple greeting can change someone's day. They's always thinking of creative ways to make guests feel even more welcomed (e.g., suggesting a "first-time guest" station with C3 merch). Alex isn't just "on the team" anymore; they're an <strong class="font-bold text-amber-700">inspiration</strong>, leading with a deep, visible <strong class="font-bold text-amber-700">passion</strong> for people and for God's house. The "how can this be?" (Mark 2:12) factor starts to show in their leadership.</li>
